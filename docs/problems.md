## Tech Tests/Code challenges

Tech Test or Code challenges are a regular part of the hiring process and that's in general a good thing. However, there are some problems with that

Sometimes proper reviews of work are not provided. By this I mean a detailed review of the work which shows at the very least that is WAS reviewed and the reasons it didn’t meet expectations

Any submission shows significant time and effort was spent by the candidate, and it’s reasonable to expect the courtesy of such a review. It only takes a few minutes and weighed against their effort, it’s inappropriate to not do it

The real problem is candidates need to avoid the same situation in the future. There are many possible reasons for a test not being accepted, some of which they need to pay attention to and some they don’t

Tests are a two way street. Candidates want to understand a team's requirements as much as the team need to understand their approach to make the process useful to both sides.  Nobody's time should be wasted on technical tests that are not needed

#### What could the process look like?

Say a hirer does an initial screening interview with HR. They decide to take things to the tech test stage, then the process could look like this;

- Candidate get sent the assignment and have a week to do it
- Currently there is no discussion or direction. Usually just a brief. A difficult target to hit
- The submission is looked at and either accepted or dismissed with no a review
- Candidate is sent the assignment and have a week to do it
- Candidate reviews the assignment, and creates a plan of how they would approach their first iteration
- Candidate meets reviewer for 30 mins to understand and discuss the plan
- Both decide whether it’s worth proceeding
- Candidate completes first iteration. It should meet all the expectations from meeting, regardless of the brief
- Candidate submit for review
- The same review that would be used in production should be provided to the candidate regardless of the hiring outcome

The only real addition is half an hour’s effort from the reviewer. Considering the candidate is being asked to put in >10x that effort, it’s not an unreasonable request. It’s much closer to how real teams operate, so it will show a more accurate picture of suitability
 
> Please properly review the submitted code. It's a small effort which shouldn't need to be requested
