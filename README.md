## Tech Tests

Sometimes proper reviews of work are not provided. By this I mean a detailed review of the work which shows at the very least that is WAS reviewed and the reasons it didn’t meet expectations. 

Any submission shows significant time and effort was spent by the candidate, and it’s reasonable to expect the courtesy of such a review. It only takes a few minutes and weighed against their effort, it’s inappropriate to not do it

The real problem is candidates need to avoid the same situation in the future. There are many possible reasons for a test not being accepted, some of which they need to pay attention to and some they don’t. 

Tests are a two way street. They need to understand the team's requirements as much as the team need to understand their approach to make the process useful to both sides.  Nobody's time should be wasted on technical tests that are not needed

#### A fairer process?

Say an employer does an initial screening. This might be an HR interview. They decide to take things to the tech test stage, then the I’d like to see the process look less like this:

- Candidate get sent the assignment and have a week to do it
- Currently there is no discussion or direction. Usually just a brief. A difficult target to hit
- The submission is looked at and either accepted or dismissed with no a review

Change it to something more like what happens in the actual job, which might look like this;

- Candidate get sent the assignment and have a week to do it
- Candidate reviews the assignment, and create a plan of how they will approach a first iteration
- Candidate meets reviewer for 30 mins to discuss & amend plan and decide whether it’s worth them going ahead any spending unpaid time proceeding
- When the first iteration is complete it should meet all the expectations from the above, regardless of the brief. 
- Submitted it for review

As you can see, the only real addition is half an hour’s effort from the reviewing developer. Considering the applicant developer is being asked to put in >10x that effort, I don’t think it’s an unreasonable request. It’s much closer to how real teams operate, so it will show a more accurate picture of suitability. 
 
> All that starts with properly reviewing the code submitted, which is a small effort on the part of the employer which would help a lot
